# Data_Wrangling
Data wrangling or data "munging" is transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another to make it more appropriate and valuable for analytics. The goal of data wrangling is to provide quality assurance and valuable data. Data analysts spend the majority of their time in the process of data wrangling compared to the actual analysis of the data. The data wrangling process may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, and training of a statistical model. Data wrangling steps begin with extracting the data, "munging," and depositing the data into a data sink
